*** WHERE ARE THE OTHER SKINS?
To get other skins and keep your theme update in the future without re-downloading anything,
please use our Express Install via https://haloroar.com/private/importer

This app is very easy to use,
but you can follow our instruction here https://wiki.roarapi.com/clientapps/#express-install


*** DOCUMENTATION
Open the file within the Documentation folder to learn more about this template.
It's easy to use but you will really need it in some cases.


*** SUPPORT

We are always willing to help you :)
